<h1>Dukey</h1>
<img src ='Images/dukey.jpg' alt="Brown, Pug, Jack Russell mix staring at the camera" width="400">
<p>Dukey is a 12 year old Pug, Jack Russell mix and lives with me and my family in Ireland. He is a very small dog, but acts much bigger than his size. He may look like an old man but still has the personality of a new born puppy.</p>
<p>Dukey`s favorite treat are rich tea cookies, as well as anything that falls off of the table at meal time. The rest of the family may call him the family dog, but both him and I know he`s really my dog, and one of my best friends.</p>

<h1>Ginger</h1>

<img src="Images/ginger.jpg" alt = "Ginger" width = "400"/>
<p> Ginger is a 6 year old Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Her favorite activities are swimming in our pool and running around our yard. Occasionally she likes to chase after squirrels and groundhogs that pop up around our yard. She also likes to hog all the dog toys in the house so nobody else can have them. She enjoys antagonizing her younger brother Hank, and you can usually see them rough housing around the house.</p>
<p>When Ginger is not playing she enjoys sitting in her bed unbothered. She will go onto her bed, and then will turn on her selective hearing. That is when you know that she will side-eye you for anything you are doing.</p>

<h1>Bacon</h1>
<img src ='Images/bacon.jpg' alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei" width="400">
<p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle.  He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him.  He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
<p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy.  He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride."  There is also a lot of rolling.  Lots and lots of rolling. </p>

<h1>Cheeto</h1>
<img src ='Images/cheeto_cattree.jpg' alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">
<p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. </p>
<p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</p>

<h1>Leo</h1>
<img src ='Images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg' alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera" width="400">
<p>Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.</p>
<p>Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.</p>
